## Notes

- [libminisketch](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch) is a library implementing
  the [PinSketch](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/code/fuzzy.html) set reconciliation algorithm.
  It is the basis for the efficient relay protocol in
  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) (covered in a [previous review
  club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18261)), but is generally usable for various
  applications that use set reconciliation. PinSketch is effectively a collection
  of algorithms doing the following:

  - Computing a "sketch" of a set of data elements (which are treated as
    numbers)

  - Combining two sketches to compute a sketch of the
    [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)
    between the two original sets (i.e., the set of elements occurring in one
    of the original sets, but not both).

  - Recovering the set of elements from its sketch, under the assumption the
    sketch is large enough.

- In this review club, we will discuss some of the math behind the algorithm,
  by reviewing the [Python
  reimplementation](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/blob/202011_pyminisketch/tests/pyminisketch.py),
  rather than the C++ code itself.  It is a full implementation of all of
  libminisketch's functions natively in Python3.  At a high level it uses the
  same algorithms as the C++ implementation, but lacking several optimizations,
  and using Python data types to represent everything. This makes it several
  orders of magnitude slower, but hopefully also makes it easier to review the
  algorithms.

- The algorithms rely heavily on properties of [finite
  fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field).  Fields are sets with an
  associated addition and multiplication operation, with all the properties you
  want for solving sets of linear equations (commutativity, associativity,
  distributivity, a "0" that is the neutral element for addition, a "1" that is
  the neutral element for multiplication, and every element except 0 having a
  multiplicative inverse). An example of a field is the rational numbers or the
  real numbers. In order to be able to represent these objects on a computer we
  however want fields with a finite number of elements. [This 9-minute
  video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9bTzjy4SCg) explains how to construct
  finite fields with any size that is a power of a prime number, using
  polynomials. In PinSketch, only finite fields whose size is a power of 2 is
  used.

- The PinSketch algorithm goes a step further, and actually operates on
  polynomials whose coefficients are finite field elements. This may be
  confusing, as the construction of those finite fields themselves also uses
  polynomials, so it's important to realize there are two layers.

- A description of PinSketch's algorithms at a high level is explained in [this
  document](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/blob/master/doc/math.md).

## Questions

1. How are finite field elements represented in Python? How do we perform
   additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions on them? How are
   polynomials with finite field coefficients represented in Python?

2. Imagine Alice and Bob have sets {a,b,c,d,f} and {b,d,e,f} respectively,
   where the variables represent distinct non-zero 8-bit field elements. Assume
   that Alice knows ahead of time that the (symmetric) difference between those
   two sets is not more than 3. Alice is going to send a sketch of her elements to
   Bob, so that Bob can learn the differences. How many bits will her sketch be in
   size? Looking at `add`, what field elements will that sketch consist of?

3. Following the same example, Bob will compute a sketch over his own elements,
   and combine it with the sketch received from Alice. What field elements will
   that combined sketch contain?  Noting that it only contains odd powers, how
   will Bob restore the even ones (see `decode`)?  Would this work if we weren't
   using power-of-two fields?

4. The next step is converting the power sums to a polynomial using the
   [Berlekamp-Massey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlekamp%E2%80%93Massey_algorithm).
   What does this algorithm do for us?

5. The final, and most complicated step to recovering the set of differences is
   finding the roots of the obtained polynomial. To do so, we first verify that
   the obtained nth degree polynomial actually has n distinct roots. It relies on
   the property that (x^(fieldsize) - x) has every field element exactly once as
   root. How does that let us test if the polynomial is fully factorizable into n
   roots? Why is this test necessary?

6. To actually find the roots, the Berlekamp Trace Algorithm is used. It uses
   the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_trace) function
   `t(x) = x + x^2 + x^4 + ... + x^(fieldsize/2)` which maps every element of a
   field of size `2^n` to `0` or `1`. In our 8-bit field that means
   `t(x) = x + x^2 + x^4 + x^8 + x^16 x^32 + x^64 + x^128`.  This means that
   for any non-zero field element `p`, `tr(p*x)` also has this property, and
   every choice of `p` will map a different subset of field elements to 0 (and the
   others to 1). How is this property used to recursively split the polynomial
   into smaller and smaller ones?
